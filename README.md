## Welcome

### 2021-01-24

Hello, this is LacLic, a programmer in university.

Now I'm studying algorithm with the help of ACM teacher in our university. What's more, I'm a big fan of computer science and mathematic. I'd be greatly happy if having chance to discuss problems or techniques together.

Currently, I've studied C++, python, dart/flutter, and doing a project relative to block chain.

Now, I'm stuck in Dynamic Programming. Hope I can master it in the near future!

That's me, and that's all.
